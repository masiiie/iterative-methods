*Numerical Math I Project *

Python implementation of the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative methods that  are the processes of successive approximations
to solve certain compatible systems of linear equations. Both require the
verification of a convergence criterion commonly known as heavy diagonal. Are
interesting alternatives to be programmed due to their relative simplicity.
